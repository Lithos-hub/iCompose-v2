iCompose is a components portfolio made with Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS. It is still in development, but you can check the progress [here](https://icompose.netlify.app/home/). The goals of this project are to practice component development and to have a place to store them for future use migrating them to a monorepo with Lerna or something similar.

Of course, contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
